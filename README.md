### :floppy_disk: Will Christenson
:wave: I'm a full-stack web developer living in Portland, Oregon.

I am fluent in a variety of modern web languages and patterns, including HTML5, CSS, and ES6+ as well as React, PostCSS, and more. I currently focus on static sites, fully custom themes for Wordpress and Shopify, as well as microservices to support those sites.
